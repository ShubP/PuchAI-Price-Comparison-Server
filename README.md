2. **Get your authtoken:**
   - Go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
   - Copy your authtoken
   - Run: `ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN`

3. **Start the tunnel:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8086
   ```

#### Option B: Deploy to Cloud (Recommended for Production)

Deploy to services like:
- **Railway** - Easy deployment with GitHub integration
